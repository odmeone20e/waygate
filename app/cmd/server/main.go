var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "waygate",
	Short: "VPN tunnel for exposing remote docker services to internet and local network",
	Long: `waygate creates a VPN network that securely exposes remote docker services (by their container names) to both internet and local development environment.
waygate has nodes of three types:

- GATEWAY: a VPS with a public IP address, accessible from the internet
- SERVER: a server to run docker-based workloads on, that should be exposed to both the public internet and local development network (by their container names)
- CLIENT: a developer machine that connects to the waygate network and has access to the docker-based services from the remote server

Spin up a complete waygate setup in four steps:

1. Start the GATEWAY, on a VPS with a public IP address execute the following command:

waygate gateway start

2. Create a new join-request, on the GATEWAY machine inside the waygate docker execute the following command:

waygate server new

-- the command will output a join-request token; copy the token

3. Start the SERVER, on a machine that should run docker-based workloads execute the following command:

waygate join <TOKEN>

-- here use the token you copied in the previous step

4. Create a new CLIENT wireguard configuration; on the GATEWAY machine inside the waygate docker execute the following command:

waygate client new

-- the command will output a wireguard configuration; copy the configuration and use it on your client machine

Done!
Now you can access the docker-based services from the remote server from your client machine and over the public internet`,
