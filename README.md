**waygate** is a self-hosted subnet proxy and VPN tunnel that securely exposes private Docker services to the Internet. Powered by WireGuard (networking), CoreDNS and Caddy (reverse proxy).

- Secure tunneling into remote development/staging/production environments to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting of remote Docker-based services
- Exposing Docker services, running in a local network (e.g., on the local machine, on a corporate network, on a NAS or on a home server), to the Internet

## Features

- Secure VPN tunneling (WireGuard)
- Automatic service discovery and hostname resolution for Docker containers (CoreDNS)
- HTTP(S) and TCP/UDP (Layer-4) reverse proxy (Caddy)
- TLS termination and 100% automated certificate provisioning and renewal
- Quick and easy setup via `waygate` CLI and pre-built Docker image
- Self-hosted

## Prerequisites

- Two **separate**, Linux-based nodes with Docker installed:
  - HOST - a Linux-based node with a public IP and open ports: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 4060/tcp and 51820/udp; serves as an entry point into the ingress network where your services are published
  - SERVER (optionally) - a Linux-based node with Docker-based services / workloads
- Arbitrary number of CLIENT machines (laptops/PCs) that will get access to the private services

## Quick Start

Get up and running in just **two commands**:

## 1. Bring a HOST online

```bash
waygate host up ubuntu@<HOST_IP> --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Important – firewall and other prerequisites</strong></summary>

`waygate host up` expects that:

1) the following ports must be reachable on the target HOST machine *before* you run the command:

* 22/tcp (SSH)
* 80/tcp and 443/tcp (HTTP/HTTPS)
* 4060/tcp (Wireport control channel)
* 51820/udp (WireGuard)

Example with UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22,80,443,4060/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw enable
```

2) Docker is installed on the target host machine
3) The account used for SSH-ing into the target HOST machine has all the necessary permissions for managing Docker containers, images and networks
</details>

## 2. Publish a local service to the Internet

```bash
waygate service publish \
  --local  http://10.0.0.2:3000 \
  --public https://demo.example.com:443
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Important - DNS config and other prerequisites</strong></summary>

1) For the service to become available over the given public URL, there must be a respective `A`-record in the DNS settings of your domain name provider, pointing to the target **HOST** machine's IP address.

2) After bootstrapping the host node with `waygate host up ...` command, you should add the respective WireGuard tunnel on your local machine

3) There must be a service running on the host and port specified in the `--local` flag provided to the `waygate service publish` command

</details>

<details>
<summary>Flags explained</summary>

* **--local** – URL of the service **on the machine where you run the command** (or another node from the newly created WireGuard network)
* **--public** – External protocol / hostname / port that will be reachable on the HOST
* Automatically provisions a trusted TLS certificate and updates Caddy's reverse proxy

</details>

## Other useful operations

Need more? Here are some other useful commands:

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Add a workload SERVER | `waygate server up ubuntu@<SERVER_IP>` |
| Remove a public endpoint | `waygate service unpublish -p https://demo.example.com:443` |
| Adjust headers/timeouts etc. | `waygate service params new -p https://demo.example.com:443 --param-value 'header_up X-Tenant-Hostname {http.request.host}'` |
| Issue extra WireGuard profiles | `waygate client new` |
| Tear down a HOST | `waygate host down <HOST_ID>` |
| Tear down a SERVER| `waygate server down ubuntu@<SERVER_IP>` |

Refer to `waygate --help` or the documentation for the full CLI reference.

## Security Considerations

- The host container runs with privileged access for network configuration
- All traffic is encrypted using WireGuard
- Control traffic is encrypted (TLS)
- HTTPS is configurable for secure web access to exposed services

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check service logs: `docker logs waygate-host` or `docker logs waygate-server`
2. Verify firewall status & make sure all required ports are open
3. Check status of the WireGuard network inside the HOST and SERVER waygate containers using `wg show` and other WireGuard commands
4. Check pingability of private services from inside HOST, SERVER and CLIENT nodes
5. If a private service is not reachable, make sure the container is running and check its logs; check whether the target container (in case of the SERVER workloads) is attached to `waygate-net` docker network (waygate agent manages this automatically).
