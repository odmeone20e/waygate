**waygate** is a self-hosted ingress proxy and VPN tunnel that securely exposes private local and Docker-based services to the Internet, with free, automatically renewable SSL certificates. Powered by WireGuard (secure networking), CoreDNS and Caddy (performant reverse proxy).

- Exposing local and Docker-based services running in a local network (e.g., on the local machine, on a corporate network, on a NAS, or on a home server) to the Internet
- Secure tunneling into remote development/staging/production environments to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting of remote Docker-based services

## Features

- SSL/TLS termination with **100% free and automated certificate provisioning and renewal**
- **Reverse proxy** with support for HTTP(S) 1/2/3, WebSocket, gRPC (over HTTP/2) and TCP/UDP (Layer-4)
- **Secure access** to internal docker-based services and admin dashboards
- **Secure VPN tunneling** (WireGuard)
- Automatic **service discovery and hostname resolution by Docker container names**
- **Multiplatform CLI** (Linux, macOS, Windows — ARM64 & AMD64)
- **Self-hosted** and **open-source**
- **High performance** with a **low memory footprint**
- [Quick and easy start](#quick-start) in self-hosted mode in just **two commands** - no tinkering with docker/compose files

## Key Concepts

- **GATEWAY** – a Linux-based machine with Docker installed, a public IP address, and the following open ports: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 4060/tcp, 51820/udp and 32420-32421/tcp+udp. This node acts as the ingress gateway and an entry point to your published services.
- **CLIENT** – any number of laptops/PCs that will connect to the WireGuard network to manage the ingress network and expose services from their local machines to the Internet.
- **SERVER** *(optional)* – one or more Linux-based machines (with Docker) that run the workloads you want to expose. These nodes join the same private WireGuard network, provided by the GATEWAY.

## Preparation

Before getting started with waygate, you need to prepare your CLIENT, GATEWAY and (optionally) SERVER nodes. This section covers all the prerequisites and setup requirements for each node type.

### CLIENT Node Preparation (e.g., your laptop/PC)

#### Prerequisites

- **Installed WireGuard client**: required for connecting to the VPN tunnel between GATEWAY, SERVER and CLIENT nodes of waygate ([official WireGuard website](https://www.wireguard.com/install/))
- **Installed waygate CLI**: required for managing services, exposed via ingress-proxy, as well as gateway, server and client nodes

#### waygate CLI Installation

**via Homebrew (macOS, Linux)**

```bash
brew install MultionLabs/waygate/waygate
```

or

**via scoop (Windows)**

```bash
scoop bucket add waygate https://github.com/MultionLabs/scoop-waygate
scoop install waygate
```

or

**from binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)**

#### ⚠️ Running Unsigned Binaries on macOS and Windows

Since the binaries are **not signed with commercial certificates**, your operating system may prevent them from launching by default.  
You will need to manually allow them.

---

##### 🪟 On Windows

When you try to launch the program, you may see a warning similar to:

> **Windows protected your PC**  
> Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

To proceed:

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

This will start the application despite the warning.

---

##### 🍎 On macOS

When you attempt to open the app or installer, you may see:

> "**waygate** cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."

To allow it:

1. Open **Finder** and locate the application or `.pkg` file.
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the file and select **Open**.
3. You will see a similar warning, but this time it includes an **Open** button.
4. Click **Open** to confirm you trust the file.

Alternatively, you can allow the app through **System Preferences**:

1. Open **Apple Menu > System Settings > Privacy & Security > General**.
2. You will see a message that the app was blocked.
3. Click **Allow Anyway**.
4. Then, try opening the app again.

---

**Note:**
- These steps are necessary **only once per file**.
- If you have any concerns about file integrity, consider [verifying checksums](https://github.com/MultionLabs/waygate/releases) or building binaries from the source code yourself.
- In enterprise environments, administrators can whitelist the binaries using Group Policy (Windows) or Gatekeeper settings (macOS).

### GATEWAY Node Preparation

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker Installation**: the gateway must have Docker installed and running
- **SSH Access**: the SSH account used for gateway bootstrapping must have privileges for executing Docker commands
- **Public IP**: the gateway must have a public IP address accessible from the Internet
- **Domain Ownership**: you must own or control the domains you plan to use with waygate
- **DNS Configuration**: if you plan on exposing local services via your own domain name, you need to configure respective DNS A-records first

Before bootstrapping your waygate gateway node, you need to ensure proper DNS configuration and gateway node firewall setup.

#### DNS Configuration

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>
If your use case does not rely on DNS-names (e.g., you're publishing services on bare IP address of the gateway node and do not use free, automatically managed SSL certificates), you may skip the whole DNS configuration step.

Otherwise, for waygate to correctly expose your local services via publicly available domain names, as well as for you to make use of automatically managed free SSL certificates, you must configure DNS records pointing to your gateway's public IP address (replace `140.120.110.10` with your gateways's node public IP):

1. **A Records**: Create A records for each domain you plan to use with waygate, pointing to your gateway's public IP address
   ```
   demo.example.com     A    140.120.110.10
   api.example.com      A    140.120.110.10
   *.example.com        A    140.120.110.10  (wildcard for subdomains)
   ```

2. **Propagation Time**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though most providers complete propagation within 15-30 minutes

3. **Verification**: You can verify DNS propagation using tools like:
   ```bash
   nslookup demo.example.com
   dig demo.example.com
   ```
</details>

#### Firewall and Ports

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>
For waygate to operate correctly on your gateway node, the following ports must be open and accessible from the Internet on that gateway node:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| 22 | TCP | SSH access for waygate installation. If you use custom SSH port, make sure to open that custom port |
| 80 | TCP | HTTP traffic and free SSL certificate validation |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS traffic |
| 4060 | TCP | waygate control channel |
| 51820 | UDP | WireGuard VPN tunnel |
| 32420-32421 | TCP/UDP | Reserved ports for exposed services |

**Ubuntu/Debian (UFW):**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22,80,443,4060/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw allow 32420:32421/tcp
sudo ufw allow 32420:32421/udp
sudo ufw enable
```

**CentOS/RHEL (firewalld):**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4060/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=51820/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=32420-32421/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=32420-32421/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Cloud Provider Firewalls:**
- **AWS**: Configure Security Groups to allow the required ports
- **GCP**: Configure Firewall Rules in VPC
- **Azure**: Configure Network Security Groups
- **DigitalOcean**: Configure Cloud Firewall
</details>

### SERVER Node Preparation

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker Installation**: the server must have Docker installed and running
- **SSH Access**: the SSH account used for server bootstrapping must have privileges for executing Docker commands

## Quick Start

Once GATEWAY and CLIENT node preparations are completed, the following two commands will help you bootstrap the gateway and expose your first service **from your local machine to the Internet**!

#### 1. Bootstrap a GATEWAY node

Run in your local terminal on your CLIENT machine:

```bash
waygate gateway up sshuser@140.120.110.10:22
```

*(replace SSH username, IP, and PORT with the real details of the GATEWAY machine)*

This command outputs a WireGuard configuration -- **import it into your WireGuard client** on your CLIENT device and **activate it** before proceeding with the next command.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced usage scenarios</summary>

Use SSH key with an empty passphrase and dump the WireGuard config straight to the file:

```bash
waygate gateway up sshuser@140.120.110.10:22 --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa --ssh-key-pass-empty > ~/path/to/wireguard-config.conf
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Important – firewall and other prerequisites</strong></summary>

`waygate gateway up` expects that:

1) the following ports must be reachable on the target GATEWAY machine *before* you run the command:

* 22/tcp (SSH)
* 80/tcp and 443/tcp (HTTP/HTTPS)
* 4060/tcp (Wireport control channel)
* 51820/udp (WireGuard)
* 32420-32421/tcp+udp (reserved ports for exposing services with waygate)

Example with UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22,80,443,4060/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw allow 32420:32421/tcp
sudo ufw allow 32420:32421/udp
sudo ufw enable
```

2) Docker is installed on the target GATEWAY machine
3) The account used for SSHing into the target GATEWAY machine has all the necessary permissions for managing Docker containers, images, and networks
</details>

<details>
<summary>waygate <strong>DOES NOT</strong> store SSH credentials</summary>

waygate relies on [goph](https://github.com/melbahja/goph) for handling SSH connections and executing commands on the target remote machines. The credentials are **never stored** by waygate and they only stay in the memory of your client device for the time of executing the commands (typically, a few seconds).
</details>

#### 2. Expose a local service to the Internet

Run in your local terminal:

```bash
waygate service publish \
  --local  http://10.0.0.2:3000 \
  --public https://demo.example.com:443
```
(assuming `10.0.0.2` is the IP address of your CLIENT device in waygate network & there is a DNS A-record for the domain `demo.example.com`, pointing to your GATEWAY node's IP address)

🎉 **Congratulations!** Your first local service running on port 3000 is now securely accessible on the Internet at `https://demo.example.com/`. waygate automatically generates and renews SSL certificates for your domain.

<details>
<summary>Command and flags explained</summary>

This command supports different protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP) and automatically provisions a free SSL certificate for the domain when an HTTPS-based URL with a domain name is specified in the **--public** parameter, provided that a correct A-record is set up in your domain provider's DNS settings and points to the GATEWAY machine.

* **--local** – address of the service **on the machine where you run the command** (or another CLIENT/SERVER node from the waygate-managed WireGuard network)
* **--public** – External protocol / hostname / port that will be reachable on the GATEWAY

If a service is supposed to be exposed using the public IP of the gateway node (e.g., to be available on `140.120.110.10`), don't specify the public IP itself in **--public** argument, but use `0.0.0.0` instead (e.g., **tcp://0.0.0.0:32420**)
</details>

---

## How it works

### Client installation

**Client Node Configuration** is stored in `~/.waygate/<profile>` folder.
Here `<profile>` equals `default`, unless it's explicitly overridden with `WIREPORT_PROFILE` environment variable (e.g., `WIREPORT_PROFILE=dev waygate -v`).

### Gateway Bootstrapping

When you run `waygate gateway up`, the following happens:

1. **SSH Connection**: waygate connects to your gateway machine via SSH
2. **Docker Installation Check**: Verifies Docker is installed and accessible to the SSH user
3. **Container Deployment**: Pulls [waygate docker image](https://github.com/MultionLabs/waygate/pkgs/container/waygate) (version matches your waygate CLI version) and starts `waygate-gateway` Docker container with:
   - WireGuard VPN server (port 51820/udp)
   - Caddy reverse proxy (ports 80/tcp, 443/tcp)
   - CoreDNS for service discovery (internal; not exposed to the Internet)
   - waygate control plane API (port 4060/tcp; secure communication with TLS-encryption and mTLS-based auth)
4. **Network Setup**: Creates a private WireGuard network (10.0.0.0/24)
5. **Certificate Generation**: Creates client certificates for secure API communication and mTLS
6. **Configuration Storage**: Stores all configuration in `~/.waygate-docker/gateway` on the gateway machineVaasankatu 9, Helsinki, Uusimaa 00500, Finland

### Server Bootstrapping

When you run `waygate server up`, the following happens:

1. **SSH Connection**: waygate connects to your server machine via SSH
2. **Docker Installation Check**: Verifies Docker is installed and accessible to the SSH user
3. **Join Token Generation**: Creates a secure token for joining the waygate network
4. **Container Deployment**: Pulls [waygate docker image](https://github.com/MultionLabs/waygate/pkgs/container/waygate) (version matches your waygate CLI version) and starts `waygate-server` Docker container with:
   - WireGuard VPN client
   - Docker network integration
   - Service discovery agent
5. **Network Integration**: Connects the server to the waygate-managed WireGuard network, provided by the gateway node
6. **Configuration Storage**: Stores all configuration in `~/.waygate-docker/server` on the server machine

| Tear down a GATEWAY | `waygate gateway down sshuser@140.120.110.10` |

Refer to `waygate --help` for the full CLI reference.

## Security Considerations

- The gateway container runs with privileged access for network configuration
- All traffic is encrypted using WireGuard
- Control traffic is encrypted (TLS)
- HTTPS is configurable for secure web access to exposed services

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check service logs: `docker logs waygate-gateway` or `docker logs waygate-server`
2. Verify firewall status & make sure all required ports are open
3. Check status of the WireGuard network inside the GATEWAY and SERVER waygate containers using `wg show` and other WireGuard commands
4. Check pingability of private services from inside GATEWAY, SERVER and CLIENT nodes
5. If a private service is not reachable, make sure the container is running and check its logs; check whether the target container (in case of the SERVER workloads) is attached to the `waygate-net` Docker network (waygate agent manages this automatically).

<details>
<summary>Test commands for TCP & UDP forwarding</summary>

For testing UDP forwarding, on the SERVER node run:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name udp-server alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache socat && socat -v UDP-RECV:3000 STDOUT"
```

- this command will start a docker container, called `udp-server`.

Now, send some test UDP packets from your CLIENT device, e.g.:

```bash
echo "hello via UDP" | nc -u 10.0.0.3 3000
```
(for a test inside the waygate network)

or

```bash
echo "hello via UDP" | nc -u 140.120.110.10 32420
```
(for a test, involving publicly exposed services, e.g. `waygate service publish --public udp://0.0.0.0:32420 --local udp://udp-server:3000` or so)

The logs of `udp-server` container on your SERVER node should log the test data.

For testing TCP forwarding, on the SERVER node run:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name tcp-server alpine sh -c "while true; do nc -lk -p 3000; done"
```

- this command will start a docker container, called `tcp-server`.

Now, send some test TCP packets from your CLIENT device, e.g.:

```bash
echo "hello via TCP" | nc 10.0.0.3 3000
```
(for a test inside the waygate network)

or

```bash
echo "hello via TCP" | nc 140.120.110.10 32420
```
(for a test, involving publicly exposed services, e.g. `waygate service publish --public tcp://0.0.0.0:32420 --local tcp://tcp-server:3000` or so)

The logs of `tcp-server` container on your SERVER node should log the test data.
